Bank Client Personal Finance Dashboard
This project is about analyzing personal finance data of bank clients and creating a dashboard with visualizations and data analytics for different clients. The project was a part of a data science job interview exercise, where I had to analyze multiple interconnected spreadsheets after transforming them to pandas data frames.

Data
The dataset provided by the bank had information about personal finances of its clients. It included data about their income, expenses, debts, assets, and liabilities. The dataset was distributed across multiple interconnected spreadsheets.

Data Cleaning and Transformation
The first step was to transform the spreadsheets into pandas data frames and merge them into a single data frame. I cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting data types.

Data Analysis and Visualizations
Next, I analyzed the data to identify trends and patterns. I created visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and line charts to visualize the data. I used seaborn and matplotlib libraries for data visualization.

I created a dashboard with different visualizations and data analytics for each client. The dashboard included visualizations such as income vs. expenses, debt vs. assets, and monthly spending patterns. I also created a summary of key performance indicators for each client, such as net worth, debt-to-income ratio, and savings rate.

Success of the project
The project was successful in achieving the objective of analyzing personal finance data of bank clients and creating a dashboard with visualizations and data analytics for different clients. The project showcased my skills in data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. The interviewer was impressed with the quality of the dashboard and the insights generated from the data analysis.

Future steps
The future steps for this project include improving the dashboard's interactivity by using tools such as Dash or Tableau. I could also use machine learning algorithms to predict future income, expenses, and savings for clients based on historical data.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project was a great experience for me to showcase my data science skills in analyzing personal finance data and creating a dashboard with visualizations and data analytics. The project was successful in impressing the interviewer, and I look forward to applying these skills in a professional setting.
